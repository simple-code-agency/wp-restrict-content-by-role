# Restrict Content by Role
WordPress plugin which allows the site admin to restrict the content access by user roles.
By restricting the access to certain pages, members of that role won't see or be allowed to edit any other pages.
Works with **pages** only, more to follow soon.

# To Do
- add posts & custom post types support
- bring back the `Mine`, `Draft`and other page statuses
- add the possibility to choose whether to **include**  or **exclude** the content
- cleanup the project, remove unneeded code

# Installation
1. Upload `restrict-content-role.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
